  <h1>Urska</h1>
  <h2>She is a dog. She is our dog.</h2>
  <p>We got Urska from the Humane Society about 10 years ago. <br>
  When we first met her we assumed she was more Black Lab vs German Shepard because she was so friendly with us. <br>
  WRONG. Within 2 weeks of staying with us, she considered our home her territory, which she ferociously gaurded. <br>
  She was incredibly athletic and loyal to us, which was great...unless other people wanted to interact with us. <br>
  It was difficult to have people over to our house. Kids were out of the question. <br>
  She finally started slowing down about two years ago, and has mellowed.<br>
  While she will still let out a throaty bark anytime someone approaches the house, she now will tolerate visitors, in between naps.</p>
